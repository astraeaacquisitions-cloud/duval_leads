# Duval County Distress Docket

A lead-recon dashboard for Duval County, FL: pulls Official Records
(Lis Pendens, Judgments, Liens, Probate, Notices of Commencement,
Satisfactions/Releases) and the upcoming Tax Deed Auction, cross-references
owner/parcel data against the Property Appraiser, scores each record as a
motivated-seller lead, and publishes it as a filterable/sortable dashboard.

## Files

- `duval_leads_scraper.py` -- the data pipeline. Run:
  `python duval_leads_scraper.py --days 7 --out records.json`
  Requires `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` (`pip install requests beautifulsoup4`).
- `duval_dashboard.html` -- the static dashboard page. Reads `records.json`
  from the same directory at load time.
- `duval_leads_db.py` -- the structured research/scoring layer (SQLite).
  See "Data ownership" below before touching this -- it is explicitly
  *not* the operational system of record yet.
- `import_history_to_sqlite.py` -- explicit, hand-run migration tool that
  imports `records.json` (or a `backup.json` export) into the SQLite
  layer. Always point `--db` at a throwaway path first to verify an
  import before running it against the real database.

## Data ownership

Several systems now hold overlapping pieces of the same picture. As of
this Phase 1 reconciliation, here is which one is authoritative for what:

| Data | Owned by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Operational lead/contact history (which distress filings exist, accumulated across runs) | `records.json`'s own accumulate-by-`doc_num` mechanism (in `duval_leads_scraper.py`) | The dashboard's only input. `--fresh` rebuilds it from scratch; otherwise every run merges into the existing file. **`records.json` is gitignored -- it only persists as long as the same container/disk does.** |
| Stable property/owner identity, evidence confidence, audit history of every run, export preparation | SQLite (`duval_leads_db.py`), durable via the git-tracked `data/backup.json` | Additive only. Reads the same accumulated `records` list the scraper already builds and layers structured fields on top (`property_id`, `owner_id`, `re_number`, confidence labels) -- it does not filter, reorder, or feed back into what `records.json` contains. |
| Qualified/contacted leads, conversations, follow-ups, deal pipeline | HubSpot (Phase 9, not yet built) | Only records explicitly approved via the dashboard's "Approve for HubSpot" control are ever exported -- never the raw scrape. |
| Portable backup, manual editing, recovery | CSV exports (`data/export_leads.csv`, `data/hubspot_export.csv`) and `data/backup.json` | Regenerable from SQLite at any time; `backup.json` is the one that's git-tracked and therefore the actual disaster-recovery copy. |
| Suppression flags, notes, HubSpot-approval marks made from the dashboard | The published artifact's `db` capability (`leads/{property_id}` docs) | A convenience write surface, not a vault -- intended to be synced into the durable database on each scheduled run, not treated as the only copy. |

**Known gap worth a decision:** because `records.json` is gitignored and
this pipeline runs in ephemeral cloud containers, the accumulate-by-`doc_num`
history only survives runs that happen to reuse the same container disk --
a fresh container starts that history over from nothing, even though SQLite's
`backup.json` (git-tracked) would still have it. Nothing in this phase
changes that; it's flagged here rather than fixed silently.

## Scheduled refresh

This repo is cloned by a scheduled cloud agent that re-runs the scraper and
republishes the dashboard's data on a recurring schedule.
